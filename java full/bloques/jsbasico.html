      <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
      <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and 
         lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host 
         environment (a web browser or Node server) , it can be to objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them. </p>

         <ul>
               <li><a>• Variable Declaration</a>JavaScriptvariables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds coffee, 
         a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names called identifiers. var x;</li>
         • Variable Assignment Assignment 01*rators assign values to JavaScript variables - ourcup can now have coffeepourui in it, giving Our 
         variable a value to hold. The assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. var x 10; 
         • Data types an important concept; to be able on variables you need to know the data type. There are Six data tyrs 
         that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - ü-ue or false; null - null aka nothing; Number - 42 or 3.14159; String - "Coding Dojo Rocks!"; 
         Array - ll , 'Coding' , 2, 'Dojo'l; and Object - (first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe') 
         • When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different blocks based on 
         values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your to accomplish this. There are following 
         conditional statements: if a specified condition is true, do this in Our block; else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first 
         condition is false; else we execute this block of C(xie; 
         • There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they Will repeat 
         an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around four and then you stop. Thats a loop! 
         • Functions are an encaspulation of a block. When we call Our function this Will mn thatcode Think of it as a list of 
         instructions. As an example imagine we ar putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started , first we 
         the legs to table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished Our instructions. Sadly diere are a ton more 
         tables to do so lets call Our function over and over and over again. </p>
