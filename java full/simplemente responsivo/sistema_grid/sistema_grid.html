                <p>CSS uses the @media rule to detect information about the 
                    device being used to access the website. For example, it 
                    can be used to detect the size ofthe device, its capabilities, 
                    and its orientation. For this course, we Will be using it to 
                    detect the device size, but keep in mind that it is capable of 
                    much more.
